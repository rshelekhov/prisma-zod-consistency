# prisma-zod-consistency

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- d4f363f: R05 now detects bypass'ed boundaries in tRPC routers — procedures whose handler accepts `input` but never declared `.input(zodSchema)` in the chain. Detection is import-gated on `@trpc/server`. The `framework` config gains `"trpc"` and the default `"auto"` now runs every detector whose import is present (Hono + tRPC together for projects that use both).

  Explicit no-input declarations (`.input(z.void())`, `.input(z.undefined())`, `.input(z.never())`) and procedures whose handler takes no arguments are not flagged.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- bc9ae98: R01 truly complete: implement R01b (generator output ↔ Prisma sanity check) and R01c (derived schemas weakening generated).

  R01 now runs all three sub-modes coordinately, dispatched per-schema:

  - **R01a** (existing) — hand-written `z.object({...})` compared to the matching Prisma model.
  - **R01b** (new) — every schema declared inside the Zod-generator `outputDir` is sanity-checked against Prisma. Catches stale generator output, contradictory `@zod.string.max(N)` annotations, and missing `.int()` on `Int` columns. Default severity: warning. No mechanical fixes (the user can't auto-edit a regenerated file).
  - **R01c** (new) — derived chains (`UserSchema.passthrough()`, `UserSchema.pick({...}).extend({...})`, etc.) where the base identifier resolves into `outputDir` are checked for weakening calls. `.passthrough()` is flagged as **error** — it defeats the validator. `.nonstrict()` is flagged as warning. Identifier resolution traverses barrel re-exports and `import { X as Y }` aliases transitively, so weakening through indirection is still caught.

  The first-class supported generator is `zod-prisma-types`. `prisma-zod-generator` and `zod-prisma` are detected best-effort.

  R01a behaviour is unchanged. The runner's per-schema dispatch means a single file can host R01a, R01c, and (transitively) R01b schemas side by side without conflict.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- eac5864: Enterprise-readiness pack — SARIF output + suppression comments.

  - **`--output sarif`** emits a SARIF 2.1.0 document conforming to the OASIS-TCS schema. Feed it to `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3` for inline PR annotations and a Security-tab dashboard. Severity maps as `error`→`error`, `warning`→`warning`, `info`→`note`. Each rule's `helpUri` points at its spec on GitHub. Live-DB findings emit a generic repository annotation since they aren't anchored to source.

  - **Suppression comments** silence individual findings without disabling a rule globally. Familiar `// pz-disable-next-line`, `// pz-disable` … `// pz-enable` syntax with optional rule lists, wildcards, and ESLint-style trailing reasons (`-- because X`). Scope: TS/TSX files for R01, R03, R04, R05. Per-rule hard-gate via `R0X.suppressionsEnabled: false`.

  Also: `--version` now reports the actual published CLI version (was hardcoded to `0.0.0`).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Republish 0.1.1 under a new version. The 0.1.1 tarball was published with an empty dist/ (build step was skipped), then unpublished — but npm bans reusing a burned version name, so the same content ships as 0.1.2. No code changes vs. 0.1.1; full polish-for-launch fixes are included (see 0.1.1 entry below for the complete list).

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 9c63ca7: Polish-for-launch pass — quality fixes uncovered while smoke-testing 0.1.0 on a real Prisma+Zod+Hono codebase:

  - **R03 codemod no longer destroys `.pipe(z.nativeEnum(...))` chains.** The case-insensitive coerce idiom `z.string().transform((v) => v.toUpperCase()).pipe(z.nativeEnum(Foo))` is already correct; the previous version naïvely replaced the leading `z.string()` with `z.nativeEnum(Foo)`, breaking the chain. The detector now also recognizes `.pipe(<knownEnumSchema>)` when the variable is itself bound to the matching Prisma enum in the project.
  - **R01 codemod inserts `.int()` before `.nullable()` / `.optional()` / `.nullish()`.** Previously it appended at the end of the chain, producing `z.number().nullable().int()`. Same applies to `.max(N)` insertion.
  - **R03 fix merges new named imports into the existing `import { ... } from "@prisma/client"`** instead of adding a second import line. Handles single-line and multi-line import blocks, with or without trailing comma.
  - **R02 reports real source line numbers** via a token-scan fallback when `@mrleebo/prisma-ast` doesn't provide them on attribute nodes (which is most of the time). Findings now point at the actual `field @relation(...)` line, not always `:1`.
  - **`pz-fix` dry-run output uses a real Myers-based unified diff** (via the `diff` package) — unchanged context lines no longer appear with `+`/`-` markers.
  - **Build script now runs `chmod +x dist/index.js`** so CI builds preserve the executable bit. The 0.1.0 publish needed a manual chmod and squeaked through despite warnings; this prevents a regression.

  Test suite: +8 vitest cases covering all of the above (33 tests total, all green). New devDep: `@types/diff` and runtime dep: `diff`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ceea60b: Initial public release of the `prisma-zod-consistency` CLI.

  Static rules (no DB needed):

  - **R01** — Zod ↔ Prisma field drift (hand-written mode), with `pz-fix` codemod for `.max(N)` / `.int()` adjustments
  - **R02** — `@relation` without explicit `onDelete`
  - **R03** — Prisma enum ↔ Zod enum sync, with `pz-fix` codemod that swaps `z.string()` for `z.nativeEnum(...)`
  - **R04** — Nullability mismatch between Prisma and Zod
  - **R05** — API boundary bypass (Hono detector — request handlers reading body without Zod validation)

  Live-DB rules (Postgres, behind `--db` flag):

  - **R07** — Redundant indexes
  - **R08** — Unused indexes (uses `pg_stat_user_indexes`)
  - **R09** — Schema drift vs live DB (column existence + nullability)

  Plus:

  - `pz-fix` subcommand with dry-run by default and `--apply` to write
  - `pretty` and `json` output formats; `sarif` is a reserved placeholder for the next release
  - cosmiconfig-based config (`.prismazodrc.{json,js,cjs,mjs}`, `prismazod.config.*`, or `package.json` field)
  - Two binaries: `prisma-zod-consistency` (canonical) and `pz-check` (alias)

  Skill bundles for Claude Code and Codex ship in the same repo but are not versioned via changesets — they ride with git tags.
